# AGENTS instructions

# Issues
Sometime, one person has many bounding boxes (2 or 3 boxes). It may be caused by "retention_secs" and SORT tracker

# Modify features
Current code is cropping images of detected persons and put them into cell phone detection models.
Now I want to crop with square ratio and zoom in 80% to focus the potential region having phones (but still draw the original box)

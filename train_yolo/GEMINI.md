# Gemini Code Assistant Project Context for `train_yolo`

This document provides context for the Gemini code assistant to understand the `train_yolo` directory.

## About this Directory

This directory contains the code for training the YOLO object detection model.

## Project Structure

*   `train.py`: The main script for training the YOLO model.
*   `train.example.sh`: An example script to run the training.
*   `datasets/`: (managed by DVC) Contains the training and validation datasets.
*   `weights/`: (managed by DVC) Contains the pre-trained and trained YOLO weights.
*   `runs/`: Contains the output of the training runs, including saved models and logs.
*   `dvclive/`: Contains logs and plots generated by `dvclive`.

## How to Run Training

1.  Make sure you have pulled the DVC data (`dvc pull`).
2.  Run the training script: `python train.py` or `sh train.example.sh`.
3.  The training script uses `dvclive` to log metrics and plots, which will be saved in the `dvclive` directory.
